               <h2>Intro</h2>
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I've been gaming since the days of the NES and Windows 3.11/MS-DOS. 
                  This early exposure sparked my interest in computers. 
                  While it's tough to pick an all-time favorite, what follows are a 
                  few games that really stand out to me. 
               </p>

                     Once my uncle first showed me how to change directories and run files 
                     in DOS I was off to the races.

               <h2>Outer Wilds</h2>
               <p>Outer Wilds is a unique adventure puzzle game. The less you know
                  going in the better. One thing I love about it is there are no 
                  arbitrary checkpoints, inventory, or point progress. All progress happens 
                  in your own mind. </p>

                  <figcaption>I finished the game in 2018 and I still enjoy watching other
                     people's playthoughs or livestreams and reliving the discovery experience 
                     through them.

               <h2>Spiritfarer</h2>
               <p>This is the most emotional game I've ever experienced. I would have 
                  never tried it but it was on the Xbox Gamepass and I was hooked right away.
                  Instead of being typical power fantasy game, it's more about acting as an
                  end of life caretaker for lost spirits who passed away and helping them to 
                  finally pass on to the afterlife.

                      passed away around the same time I finished the game. It played a large role
                     in my grief.</figcaption>

               <h2>VTOL VR</h2>
               <p>VTOL VR is a near future VR combat flight simulator. It's the perfect balance
                   between an accessable action game and a highly realistic flight simulator. 
                   Designed to be fully interactive in VR, there's no need for hardware controls 
                  (execpt for maybe a foot rudder).

                     These are old captures. The game continues to improve over the years and 
                     was mostly developed by only one guy.

               <p>My passion for gaming convinced me to learn about game development as a 
                  hobby and to help me prepare to move into the tech field.
